                    li User Story: I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).
                    li User Story: If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
                    li User Story: If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.
